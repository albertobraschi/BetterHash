-------------------------
Small Magento module that uses sha512 instead of md5 to has passwords in Magento 
Community Edition

**WARNING** - when installed, all current admin and user passwords will no longer work and will have to be reset.  It would be best to use this module at the start of a project.  Likewise, any passwords created while this module is active will not work until reset if the module is removed.
